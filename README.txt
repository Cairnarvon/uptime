A cross-platform uptime for the Python.

Tested on Debian Linux, FreeBSD, Windows XP, Mac OS X Lion, and OpenIndiana.
Additionally expected to work with every vaguely reasonable Linux and BSD,
every Windows since Windows 2000, and Plan 9 From Bell Labs.
Known *not* to work with Syllable or RISC OS. Patches welcome.
