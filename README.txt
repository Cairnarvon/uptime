A cross-platform uptime for the Python.

Tested on Debian Linux, FreeBSD, Windows XP, and Mac OS X Lion.
Expected to work with every vaguely reasonable Linux and BSD, every Windows
since Windows 2000, and Plan 9 From Bell Labs.
Known *not* to work with Syllable, RISC OS, or Solaris. Patches welcome.
